# Beginner-Friendly Configuration
# Perfect for developers just starting with codebase validation
# Gentle introduction with helpful explanations and relaxed standards

  agents:
    # 📚 Essential Files - Start with the basics
    essential-files:
      enabled: true
      require_readme: true           # Every project needs a welcoming README
      require_contributing: false    # Optional for personal projects
      require_docs_directory: false # Can add documentation later
      
    # ⚙️ Git Configuration - Keep things tidy
    git-configuration:
      enabled: true
      require_gitignore: true        # Essential - keeps junk out of your repo
      require_gitattributes: false   # Advanced feature, skip for now
      require_editorconfig: false    # Nice to have, not required initially
      
    # 📝 Development Standards - Learn good habits gradually
    development-standards:
      enabled: true
      check_commit_history: true
      commit_history_depth: 5        # Check only recent commits
      require_conventional_commits: false  # Learn this later
      validation_threshold: 0.3      # Very forgiving - 30% is enough to start

  # 🎨 Output settings - Keep it simple and encouraging
  output:
    format: "table"                  # Pretty, human-readable output
    verbose: false                   # Don't overwhelm with details

  # 📊 Scoring - Encouraging for beginners
  scoring:
    pass_threshold: 0.5              # 50% score is passing - you've got this!
    warning_threshold: 0.3           # Only warn if really struggling

# 🎯 What this config does:
# - Checks for a README (the most important file!)
# - Makes sure you have a .gitignore (prevents common mistakes)
# - Gently encourages good development practices
# - Celebrates your progress rather than focusing on what's missing
#
# 🌱 As you grow:
# - Enable CONTRIBUTING.md when you want collaborators  
# - Add docs/ directory when your project gets complex
# - Turn on conventional commits to learn industry standards
# - Gradually increase thresholds as you improve
#
# 🎉 Perfect starting point for:
# - Personal projects and learning exercises
# - First-time open source contributors
# - Teams adopting validation tools gradually
# - Anyone who wants to start simple and grow

# Expected minimal project structure:
# my-awesome-project/
# ├── README.md        # Tells people what your project does
# ├── .gitignore       # Keeps build files and secrets safe
# └── src/            # Your actual code
